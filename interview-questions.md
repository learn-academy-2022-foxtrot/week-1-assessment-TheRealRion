# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a line of code that stipulates the computer to do something based on certain predetermined criteria. 

Researched answer: A conditional statement can also be referred to as an expression, flow statement, or processing and stipulates a set of rules performed if outlined criteria is met. Additionally, it can be called an "if-then" statement. 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software developed in the early 200s that tracks changes to code on a local device (personal computer). GitHub is a cloud-based website that uses Git, and makes it connect to other servers/computers via the internet. 

Researched answer: WHile Git is a version control system that allows a user to keep track of source code history, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you host Git repositories (databases) outside of a local device via the internet. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: A Boolean value is one that is either true or false. These can be implemented as stements that use and (&&), or (||), or not (!). 

Researched answer: The three boolean opperators are AND, OR and NOT and can be used to create boolean statements and return boolean values such as true or false. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is an element's position in an array, where the value is the element's content. 

Researched answer: Beginning with 0, an index states a position of an element in an array, where the value describes an element's content. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: An array is a container to store a list of data between brackets ([]). A string is a length of code between quotation marks(""). Both can hold letters, numbers, and characters. Arrays can include strings as elements. 

Researched answer: An array is a sequential collection of elements stored as a variable that can hold more than one value at a time and are mutable. A string is a  sequence of characters represented as a single data element that can be stored. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming consists of two coders working together as driver (typer of code) and navigator (tells driver what to type) to create code. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development tool used where two programmers work in tandem at one workstation. The driver writes out the code while the navigator reviews the code written to check for errors/bugs and contineuity. The team switches roles frequently. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

2. Jest: A JS testing framework 

3. Objects: Containers for named values called properties. 

4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects using existing code/function in the JS program 

5. Classes: A template to create objects that encloses data with code to work on that data.
